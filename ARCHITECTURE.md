## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The QA System provides functionality to add new files for embedding, remove existing embeddings, list currently embedded files, and perform semantic queries against the embedded content. The system focuses solely on efficient file processing, embedding generation, and vector storage.

### 1.2 Key Features
- File management operations (add, remove, list, query)
- Local file processing and embedding generation
- Vector database storage and semantic search capabilities
- Support for multiple file formats
- Efficient batch processing
- Comprehensive metadata tracking and management

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Components

The system is composed of several key components which are designed to be modular and independent, with clear interfaces defined in their respective architecture documents:

0. **Common Components** ([ARCHITECTURE-common-components.md](ARCHITECTURE-common-components.md))
   - Main Module: Command-line interface and system entry point
   - Configuration Module: Manages system-wide settings and environment variables
   - Logging Setup: Centralized logging with file and console output
   - Vector Database: ChromaDB-based vector storage and retrieval
   For detailed information about shared components, including configuration, logging, and the vector database, refer to the common components documentation.

1. **Adding Files** ([ARCHITECTURE-add-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-add-flow.md))
   - File Scanner: Discovers and validates files for processing
   - Document Processors: Handles multiple file formats (PDF, Text, Markdown, CSV, Images)
   - Embedding Generator: Creates vector embeddings using Gemini model
   - Metadata Management: Tracks document information and relationships
   For detailed information about the file addition process, document processors, and embedding generation, refer to the add flow documentation.

2. **Listing** ([ARCHITECTURE-list-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-list-flow.md))
   - Pattern-based document filtering
   - Collection statistics and metrics
   - Metadata retrieval and formatting
   - Integration with vector database queries
   For detailed information about listing stored documents and retrieving metadata, refer to the list flow documentation.

3. **Removal** ([ARCHITECTURE-remove-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-remove-flow.md))
   - Pattern matching for document selection
   - Batch removal operations
   - Consistency verification
   - Error recovery procedures
   - Transaction management
   For detailed information about document removal, cleanup procedures, and consistency checks, refer to the remove flow documentation.

4. **Query** ([ARCHITECTURE-query-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-query-flow.md))
   - Query Processor: Handles semantic search and similarity calculations
   - Response Generator: Creates contextual responses using Gemini model
   - Multiple query types (Basic, Advanced, Hybrid)
   - Source attribution and confidence scoring
   For detailed information about semantic querying, response generation, and the Gemini model integration, refer to the query flow documentation.

### 2.2 Component Details

Each component is documented in detail in its respective architecture document. The components are designed to be:

1. **Modular**: Each component operates independently with well-defined interfaces
2. **Extensible**: New functionality can be added without modifying existing components
3. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and comprehensive documentation
4. **Reliable**: Built-in error handling and recovery procedures
5. **Performant**: Optimized for efficient processing and resource usage

## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 System Requirements
- Python 3.13 or higher
- Vector database support (e.g., Chroma)
- Sufficient storage for embeddings and metadata
- GPU support (optional, for improved performance)

### 3.2 Configuration and Main Modules
Configuration is managed through a combination of:
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Command-line arguments

Key modules are documented in their respective component architecture documents. For detailed configuration information, refer to the [Configuration Module](ARCHITECTURE-common-components.md#3-configuration-module) documentation.

### 3.3 API Specifications
The system exposes a command-line interface with consistent argument patterns across all operations. Internal APIs between components are documented in the respective architecture documents. For detailed API information, refer to the [Main Module](ARCHITECTURE-common-components.md#2-main-module) documentation.

## 4. Implementation Strategy
The implementation follows these key principles:

1. Modularity: Each component is independently maintainable
2. Extensibility: New file types and embedding models can be added
3. Reliability: Comprehensive error handling and validation
4. Performance: Efficient processing and storage optimization

## 5. Dependencies
Core dependencies are managed through requirements.txt and include:
- Vector database libraries
- Embedding model frameworks
- File processing utilities
- CLI argument parsing

Each component's specific dependencies are listed in their respective architecture documents.
