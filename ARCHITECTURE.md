## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The QA System provides functionality to add new files for embedding, remove existing embeddings, list currently embedded files, and perform semantic queries against the embedded content. The system focuses solely on efficient file processing, embedding generation, and vector storage.

### 1.2 Key Features
- File management operations (add, remove, list, query)
- Local file processing and embedding generation
- Vector database storage and semantic search capabilities
- Support for multiple file formats
- Efficient batch processing
- Comprehensive metadata tracking and management

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Components

The system is composed of several key components, each with its own dedicated architecture document:

0. **Common Components** ([ARCHITECTURE-common-components.md](ARCHITECTURE-common-components.md))
   - Core utilities and shared functionality
   - Configuration management
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Error handling

1. **Adding Files** ([ARCHITECTURE-add-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-add-flow.md))
   - File scanning and validation
   - Document processing by type
   - Embedding generation
   - Vector and metadata storage

2. **Listing** ([ARCHITECTURE-list-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-list-flow.md))
   - Document metadata retrieval
   - Filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Information display and statistics
   - Status reporting

3. **Removal** ([ARCHITECTURE-remove-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-remove-flow.md))
   - Request validation
   - Vector database cleanup
   - Metadata management
   - Consistency verification
