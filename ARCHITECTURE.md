## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The QA System provides functionality to add new files for embedding, remove existing embeddings, list currently embedded files, and perform semantic queries against the embedded content. The system focuses solely on efficient file processing, embedding generation, and vector storage.

### 1.2 Key Features
- File management operations (add, remove, list, query)
- Local file processing and embedding generation
- Vector database storage and semantic search capabilities
- Support for multiple file formats
- Efficient batch processing
- Comprehensive metadata tracking and management

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Components

The system is composed of several key components which are designed to be modular and independent, with clear interfaces defined in their respective architecture document:

0. **Common Components** ([ARCHITECTURE-common-components.md](ARCHITECTURE-common-components.md))
   - Core utilities and shared functionality
   - Configuration management
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Error handling

1. **Adding Files** ([ARCHITECTURE-add-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-add-flow.md))
   - File scanning and validation
   - Document processing by type
   - Embedding generation
   - Vector and metadata storage

2. **Listing** ([ARCHITECTURE-list-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-list-flow.md))
   - Document metadata retrieval
   - Filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Information display and statistics
   - Status reporting

3. **Removal** ([ARCHITECTURE-remove-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-remove-flow.md))
   - Request validation
   - Vector database cleanup
   - Metadata management
   - Consistency verification

4. **Query** ([ARCHITECTURE-query-flow.md](ARCHITECTURE-query-flow.md))
   - Query processing and validation
   - Vector similarity search
   - Result ranking and filtering
   - Response formatting


## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 System Requirements
- Python 3.13 or higher
- Vector database support (e.g., Chroma)
- Sufficient storage for embeddings and metadata
- GPU support (optional, for improved performance)

### 3.2 Configuration and Main Modules
Configuration is managed through a combination of:
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Command-line arguments

Key modules are documented in their respective component architecture documents.

### 3.3 API Specifications
The system exposes a command-line interface with consistent argument patterns across all operations. Internal APIs between components are documented in the respective architecture documents.

## 4. Implementation Strategy
The implementation follows these key principles:

1. Modularity: Each component is independently maintainable
2. Extensibility: New file types and embedding models can be added
3. Reliability: Comprehensive error handling and validation
4. Performance: Efficient processing and storage optimization

## 5. Dependencies
Core dependencies are managed through requirements.txt and include:
- Vector database libraries
- Embedding model frameworks
- File processing utilities
- CLI argument parsing

Each component's specific dependencies are listed in their respective architecture documents.
